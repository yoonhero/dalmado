> Dalmado is the first painting by King Seonjong, who was active in China around the 6th century.

My art homework is recreating Korea Art. And I decided to make AI Filter to make my teacher be surprised.

It's a nice experience to me. I made this using Python, Mediapipe. After I got trial and error, I was finally made it. Nice!

## Try it ✨

First Clone my github project.
And Install Opencv and Mediapipe.

Then, run this command.

```bash
python3 apply_filter.py
```
